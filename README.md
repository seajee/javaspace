# Javaspace

Javaspace is the modern way to use spaces efficiently in programs, especially with programs written in Java and C++.<br><br>
<i>Somone said that the only difference between Java and C++ is the spaces. So this is it.</i>

## Java++ Example

```java
#include <iostream>

public static void main(String[] args) {
    std::cout << "Hello, world" << std::endl;
}
```

## Coffe Example

```cpp
public class Example {
    int main() {
        System.out.println("Hello, world");
    }
}
```

# The Idea

The fundamental idea is how many spaces you use in your program. This because it is important to demonstrate a superior level of intelligence when writing esoteric code. For more examples, you can take a look at the examples in the repository.<br>
